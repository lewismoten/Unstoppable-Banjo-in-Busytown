			<h1>Web RTC Example: Answer</h1>

			<p>
				This example needs a peer to make an
				<a href="offer.html">offer</a>
				and another peer to
				<a href="answer.html">answer</a>
				the offer.
			</p>

			<div id="logWindow" class="log">Ready</div>

			<h2>Establishing a Peer-to-Peer connection</h2>
			<p>
				The remote peer will initiate a connection.
				This peer will take the remote peers offer and create an answer.
			</p>

			<h3>Remote Session Description</h3>

			<p>
				The remote peer will create a new session description
				and send it as an offer. The SDP (Session Description Protocol)
				also known as a session profile
				describes the communications of the session.
				It would specify type of data to exchange
				such as audio and/or video. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Paste the SDP from the remote peer.
			</p>

			Signaling State: <span id="signalingState">Unknown</span><br />
			<textarea id="remoteSessionDescription" class="sdp"></textarea>
			<button onclick="onAcceptOffer()">Accept Offer</button>


			<h3>Local Session Description</h3>

			<p>
				A local session description is prepared and sent
				in response to the offer as an answer.

			</p>
			<p>
				Copy the SDP and send it to the remote peer.
			</p>

			<textarea id="localSessionDescription" class="sdp"></textarea>

			<h2>Establishing Connections</h2>
			<p>
				Although the two peers are aware of each other, and the type
				of data that will be exchanged, they are not yet aware of how
				to reach one another. When local session descriptions were 
				set, each peer started creating ICE (Interactive Connectivity
				Establishment) candidates if communications are required. 
				These candidates offer information regarding IP addresses,
				protocols, and ports for each network device. 
			</p>

			<h3>Remote ICE Candidates</h3>
			<p>
				The remote peer may have ice candidates to
				establish a connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paste the ICE candidates from the remote peer.
			</p>
			<textarea id="remoteIceCandidates" class="ice"></textarea>

			<button onclick="onAddIceCandidates()">Add Remote Ice Candidates</button>


			<h3>Local ICE Candidates</h3>
			<p>
				The list of ICE candidates will need to be passed to
				the remote peer. They will identify the shortest route that
				can be used to reach the local peer. Only one of the peers needs
				to be able to reach the other to establish a connection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Copy the local ICE candidates and send them to the remote peer.
			</p>
			
			ICE Gathering State: <span id="iceGatheringState">Unknown</span><br />
			ICE Connection State: <span id="iceConnectionState">Unknown</span><br />
			
			<textarea id="localIceCandidates" class="ice"></textarea>

			<h2>Exchanging Messages</h2>
			<p>
				Now that both peers are connected to
				each other with open data channels,
				they can send messages back and forth.
			</p>

			<input id="messageTextBox">
